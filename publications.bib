	abstract = {Sense of academic futility entails feelings of having no control over ones' educational success. Although mounting evidence points to its negative consequences for students' educational outcomes, less is known about its socio-­contextual antecedents. Relatedly, the current study explored how fair and supportive relationships with teachers are related to the sense of academic futility and if class belonging mediates this link in a sample of adolescents with immigrant and non-­immigrant backgrounds. A total of 1065 seventh-­grade students (Mage = 13.12; SD = 0.42; 45\% girls) from 55 classrooms completed questionnaires at two time points 1 year apart. Results of multilevel analyses indicated that fair and supportive relationships with teachers contributed to decreases in sense of academic futility at the individual but not at the classroom level. No mediation or moderation effects emerged. These findings highlight the crucial role of democratic student–teacher relationships in supporting the positive school adjustment of all students in increasingly multicultural societies.},

	abstract = {Ethnic prejudice has negative effects on the well-being of ethnic minorities. However, less is known about the consequences of holding negative attitudes toward diversity for ethnic majority youth in current multicultural societies. Across two studies, the current research examined the medium-term (Study I) and day-to-day (Study II) reciprocal associations between affective and cognitive prejudice and several well-being outcomes (i.e., subjective, psychological, and social well-being, physical health, and sleep) among ethnic majority adolescents. In Study I (N = 1103; Mage = 15.66, 48.59\% females), ethnic prejudice was found to be mostly linked longitudinally and concurrently to decreases in well-being indicators, although with a few exceptions, at both the within- and between-person levels. Conversely, in Study II (N = 458; Mage = 15.59, 54.77\% females), poorer subjective well-being and physical health were associated with increases in prejudice on the next day. Together, these ﬁndings suggest a spiraling effect whereby poor well-being leads to short-term increases in prejudice, which in turn contribute to medium-term decreases in well-being. Overall, this research highlights for the ﬁrst time the intertwined nature of prejudice and well-being among ethnic majority youth and suggests the need to support adolescents in navigating the diversity of current societies.},

The results of cross-lagged models indicated that empathic concern was directly and indirectly associated with reduced affective, cognitive, and behavioral ethnic prejudice, while perspective-taking was linked to increases in cognitive and one facet of behavioral (i.e., lower contact willingness) prejudice. Furthermore, the prevalence of affect over cognition was found, with the affective component of both empathic competences (i.e., empathic concern) and ethnic prejudice exerting the strongest inﬂuence on the cognitive ones.},

Therefore, this review aimed to summarize findings from available longitudinal research to understand the role of structural factors and experiences in the distal contexts of development in influencing sleep quality in adolescence. A total of 10 studies were included in this systematic review. The results highlighted the detrimental consequences of structural factors and experiences at the exo- and macro-systems for adolescents’ sleep duration, quality, and disturbances. Specifically, neighborhood economic deprivation, ethnic/racial minority status, community violence and victimization, and ethnic/racial discrimination were all linked to significantly lower sleep quality. Overall, this review highlighted the need for more longitudinal and multimethod studies addressing sleep quality as embedded in contexts and the reciprocal influences among the multiple layers of adolescents’ development.},

Because identity and acculturation tasks are embedded in core domains of adolescents’ life, this three-wave longitudinal study with ethnic minority adolescents (N = 244, 43.4\% male; Mage = 14.9) examined how personal identity processes and social identifications are related to acculturation orientations in the education and friendship domains. Results of traditional cross-lagged models showed that, in the educational domain, adolescents who scored higher on cultural heritage maintenance compared to their peers, scored higher on commitment later on. In the friendship domain, stronger associations were found, such that adolescents who scored higher on cultural heritage maintenance compared to their peers, reported higher commitment and in-depth exploration later on, while those who scored higher on identification with friends reported over time also higher cultural heritage maintenance and destination culture adoption. Random-intercept crossed-lagged models indicated that, when adolescents reported above their own average on reconsideration of educational commitment, they reported increased cultural heritage maintenance later on. Furthermore, consistent associations (at baseline and over time) emerged. Overall, this study points to virtuous alliances between the fulfillment of tasks related to adolescents’ identity development and acculturation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Ethnic prejudice poses a great challenge to the cohesion of current multicultural societies. Prior research has found that media portrayals of immigration‐related issues might skew individual attitudes and feelings toward ethnic minorities. While these studies have focused on negative representations of ethnic minorities, less is known about the eﬀects of media reports of unfortunate events aﬀecting the victims of war, as in the case of the Ukrainian group in the Russia–Ukraine war. Therefore, the current research aims to examine whether media salience of this situation might change adolescents' ethnic prejudice against the Ukrainian minority.
Methods: A total of 1016 ethnic‐majority Italian adolescents (Mage = 15.66, SDage = 1.17, 49.61\% females) completed online questionnaires during school hours before (T1: January/February 2022) and after (T2: April/May 2022) the Russia–Ukraine war onset. Additionally, the media salience of the war was quantiﬁed separately for the national newspaper and Twitter.
Results: Levels of prejudice signiﬁcantly decreased from T1 to T2 for multiple ethnic minority groups but especially so for the Ukrainian group. The results of bivariate Latent Change Score models highlighted that increased salience of the war in the national newspaper was signiﬁcantly associated with decreased prejudice against Ukrainians, regardless of adolescents' levels of self‐reported newspaper consumption. Conversely, changes in the salience of the war on Twitter were not associated with changes in prejudice.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings highlight the importance of media attention for the war's victims in skewing individuals' outgroup perceptions and feelings.},

A total of 883 Italian majority adolescents (Mage = 15.66, SD = 1.15 at T1, 49.7\% females) completed questionnaires at four time points over the course of 1 year. Results showed that national identification was related to more prejudice at the between-­person level but to decreases in prejudice at the within-­person level.

Common and unique associations also emerged across different ethnic minority targets, but only for between-­person effects. Overall, this study highlights the importance of distinguishing stable individual levels and momentary fluctuations of both ingroup identifications and ethnic prejudice in order to orient future interventions aimed at improving the quality of intergroup relationships.},

Recently, physical activity implications for people with disabilities have been explored, showing promising results on quality of life and self-concept. However, few studies have specifically investigated the effects of participation in adaptive sports on quality of life in patients with neuromuscular disease. Objective To evaluate differences in psychosocial well-being between people affected by a neuromuscular disease who play wheelchair hockey and those who do not. Individuals playing an adaptive sport would report better quality of life, higher physical self-efficacy scores, and more effective coping strategies, as assessed by self-reported measures. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Data were collected during clinical follow-ups at the NEMO Clinical Center in Milan (Italy). Participants A total of 25 patients affected by neuromuscular diseases, ages 18 to 40 years, participated in the study. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was to compare quality of life between groups. Secondary outcomes were the comparisons of physical self-efficacy and coping strategies through self-reported measures. Results Wheelchair hockey players scored significantly higher on the Quality of Life Index (specifically on the health/functioning and psychological/spiritual sub-scales) and reported better physical self-efficacy and perceived physical ability compared to the control group (i.e., patients who do not participate in any adaptive sport), controlling for age and pathology. On the contrary, no difference was found in coping strategies between the two groups. Conclusions This study identified a significant association between participation in wheelchair hockey and improved physical and psychological well-being of people affected by neuromuscular diseases compared to those who are not involved in adaptive sports.},

	abstract = {Teachers play a crucial role in fostering inclusive school environments for students from diverse backgrounds. However, harboring prejudiced attitudes towards minority students can have adverse social and psychological effects on these individuals. This study investigates the ethnic and homophobic prejudice profiles of Italian secondary school teachers (N = 552, Mage = 46.15, 76.4\% females) using a person-centered approach. It explores how these prejudice profiles predict moral disengagement mechanisms, self-efficacy, and social anxiety among teachers. Participants completed assessments on subtle and blatant ethnic prejudice, attitudes toward the representation of homosexuality, moral disengagement, self-efficacy in teaching, and social anxiety. Latent profile analysis identified three prejudice profiles among teachers: low, moderate, and high prejudice. The results, based on a structural equation model, revealed that teachers with high prejudice profiles were more likely to employ moral disengagement mechanisms and reported higher levels of social anxiety. The study underscores the significance of interventions and monitoring efforts tailored to educators, encompassing their social, moral, and individual dimensions.},
