abstract: Personal identity and social identification processes can be challenging
  for adolescents belonging to an ethnic minority, who have to cope with the acculturation
  task of navigating several (and often conflictual) alternatives put forth by their
  cultural heritage community and destination society. Because identity and acculturation
  tasks are embedded in core domains of adolescents’ life, this three-wave longitudinal
  study with ethnic minority adolescents (N = 244, 43.4% male; Mage = 14.9) examined
  how personal identity processes and social identifications are related to acculturation
  orientations in the education and friendship domains. Results of traditional cross-lagged
  models showed that, in the educational domain, adolescents who scored higher on
  cultural heritage maintenance compared to their peers, scored higher on commitment
  later on. In the friendship domain, stronger associations were found, such that
  adolescents who scored higher on cultural heritage maintenance compared to their
  peers, reported higher commitment and in-depth exploration later on, while those
  who scored higher on identification with friends reported over time also higher
  cultural heritage maintenance and destination culture adoption. Random-intercept
  crossed-lagged models indicated that, when adolescents reported above their own
  average on reconsideration of educational commitment, they reported increased cultural
  heritage maintenance later on. Furthermore, consistent associations (at baseline
  and over time) emerged. Overall, this study points to virtuous alliances between
  the fulfillment of tasks related to adolescents’ identity development and acculturation.
