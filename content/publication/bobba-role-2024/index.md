abstract: 'Teachers play a crucial role in fostering inclusive school environments
  for students from diverse backgrounds. However, harboring prejudiced attitudes towards
  minority students can have adverse social and psychological effects on these individuals.
  This study investigates the ethnic and homophobic prejudice profiles of Italian
  secondary school teachers (N = 552, Mage = 46.15, 76.4% females) using a person-centered
  approach. It explores how these prejudice profiles predict moral disengagement mechanisms,
  self-efficacy, and social anxiety among teachers. Participants completed assessments
  on subtle and blatant ethnic prejudice, attitudes toward the representation of homosexuality,
  moral disengagement, self-efficacy in teaching, and social anxiety. Latent profile
  analysis identified three prejudice profiles among teachers: low, moderate, and
  high prejudice. The results, based on a structural equation model, revealed that
  teachers with high prejudice profiles were more likely to employ moral disengagement
  mechanisms and reported higher levels of social anxiety. The study underscores the
  significance of interventions and monitoring efforts tailored to educators, encompassing
  their social, moral, and individual dimensions.'
