 abstract = {Moral pride—the warm glow that follows a moral action—is a vital part of a virtue development. This study showed that, although children are more likely to experience moral pride with age, the potential for moral pride to motivate prosocial action may be speciﬁc to certain cultural contexts. Ultimately, this work can inform interventions that nurture children’s positive emotional repertoires and their kindness toward peers.},
