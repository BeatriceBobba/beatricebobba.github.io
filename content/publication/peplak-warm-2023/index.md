abstract: Moral pride—the warm glow that follows a moral action—is a vital part of
  a virtue development. This study showed that, although children are more likely
  to experience moral pride with age, the potential for moral pride to motivate prosocial
  action may be speciﬁc to certain cultural contexts. Ultimately, this work can inform
  interventions that nurture children’s positive emotional repertoires and their kindness
  toward peers.
