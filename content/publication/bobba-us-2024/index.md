abstract: Although there have been numerous studies on the relations between group
  identification and ethnic prejudice, it is less clear whether their associations
  reflect stable individual tendencies or rather situational or temporal fluctuations.
  This longitudinal multilevel study aimed to fill this gap by examining the between-­and
  within-­person associations of identification with the national and superordinate
  human groups and levels of prejudice against multiple ethnic minorities. A total
  of 883 Italian majority adolescents (Mage = 15.66, SD = 1.15 at T1, 49.7% females)
  completed questionnaires at four time points over the course of 1 year. Results
  showed that national identification was related to more prejudice at the between-­person
  level but to decreases in prejudice at the within-­person level. Additionally, human
  identification contributed to lower levels of and steeper decreases in prejudice
  at both the between-­and within-­person levels. Common and unique associations also
  emerged across different ethnic minority targets, but only for between-­person effects.
  Overall, this study highlights the importance of distinguishing stable individual
  levels and momentary fluctuations of both ingroup identifications and ethnic prejudice
  in order to orient future interventions aimed at improving the quality of intergroup
  relationships.
