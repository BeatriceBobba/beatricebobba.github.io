abstract: Ethnic prejudice poses great challenges to adolescents' adjustment to multicultural
  societies. However, little is known about the role of the media in influencing attitudes
  in adolescence. Combining information environment and ecological development theories,
  the current study examined the longitudinal associations between the quantity, valence
  (i.e., neutral, positive, and negative), and target (i.e., migrant, refugee, and
  foreigner) of the news about ethnic minority groups and youth's affective and cognitive
  prejudice. In total, 962 adolescents (Mage = 15.67, 48.13% females) completed questionnaires
  at two time points, and news data were gathered from a national newspaper. While
  news quantity did not matter, positive and negative news were respectively associated
  with reduced and increased levels of cognitive, but not affective, prejudice. Nuanced
  associations emerged when accounting for the news target. Results were replicated
  regardless of adolescents' direct consumption of newspapers. These findings highlight
  the role of the information environment and suggest the need to account for it in
  planning interventions.
