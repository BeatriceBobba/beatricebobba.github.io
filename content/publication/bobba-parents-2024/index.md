abstract: The family and classroom are important contexts that can contribute to the
  socialization of ethnic prejudice. However, less is known about their unique, relative,
  and synergic contributions in influencing youth's affective and cognitive prejudice.
  The current longitudinal study examined these processes and possible moderators
  among 688 Italian youth (49.13% girls; Mage = 15.61 years), their parents (nmothers = 603,
  nfathers = 471; Mage = 49.51 years), and classmates between January/ February 2022
  and January/February 2023. Cross-­lagged panel models highlighted that parents and
  classmates exert unique and relative influences on different dimensions of adolescents'
  prejudice. Additionally, different interaction effects also emerged for affective
  (i.e., adverse compensatory effect) and cognitive (i.e., amplifying effect) prejudice.
  Thus, adolescents draw from the multiple contexts of development to orient themselves
  in the social world.
