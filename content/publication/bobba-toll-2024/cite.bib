 abstract = {Ethnic prejudice has negative effects on the well-being of ethnic minorities. However, less is known about the consequences of holding negative attitudes toward diversity for ethnic majority youth in current multicultural societies. Across two studies, the current research examined the medium-term (Study I) and day-to-day (Study II) reciprocal associations between affective and cognitive prejudice and several well-being outcomes (i.e., subjective, psychological, and social well-being, physical health, and sleep) among ethnic majority adolescents. In Study I (N = 1103; Mage = 15.66, 48.59% females), ethnic prejudice was found to be mostly linked longitudinally and concurrently to decreases in well-being indicators, although with a few exceptions, at both the within- and between-person levels. Conversely, in Study II (N = 458; Mage = 15.59, 54.77% females), poorer subjective well-being and physical health were associated with increases in prejudice on the next day. Together, these ﬁndings suggest a spiraling effect whereby poor well-being leads to short-term increases in prejudice, which in turn contribute to medium-term decreases in well-being. Overall, this research highlights for the ﬁrst time the intertwined nature of prejudice and well-being among ethnic majority youth and suggests the need to support adolescents in navigating the diversity of current societies.},
