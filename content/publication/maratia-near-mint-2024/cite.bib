 abstract = {Integration of people with a migrant background is essential to foster cohesion and well-being in contemporary societies. This study demonstrated that the Attitudes Toward Migrant Integration Policies scale can be a reliable tool to evaluate to what extent individuals from different generations hold positive attitudes toward policies aimed at promoting the integration of people with a migrant background. Adolescents reported more positive attitudes toward integration policies compared to their parents but not to their teachers, who reported the highest level of inclusiveness. Understanding the attitudes toward integration policies of individuals from different generations and with different roles might be a starting point to develop possible interventions in different contexts and to unveil which agents (e.g., teachers) can play a crucial role in promoting social cohesion.},
