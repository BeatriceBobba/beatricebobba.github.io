abstract: Integration of people with a migrant background is essential to foster cohesion
  and well-being in contemporary societies. This study demonstrated that the Attitudes
  Toward Migrant Integration Policies scale can be a reliable tool to evaluate to
  what extent individuals from different generations hold positive attitudes toward
  policies aimed at promoting the integration of people with a migrant background.
  Adolescents reported more positive attitudes toward integration policies compared
  to their parents but not to their teachers, who reported the highest level of inclusiveness.
  Understanding the attitudes toward integration policies of individuals from different
  generations and with different roles might be a starting point to develop possible
  interventions in different contexts and to unveil which agents (e.g., teachers)
  can play a crucial role in promoting social cohesion.
