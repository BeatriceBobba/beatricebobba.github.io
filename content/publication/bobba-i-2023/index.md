abstract: The ways in which youth reach a stable identity, a core developmental task
  of emerging adulthood, are intertwined with their perceptions of the past, present,
  and future. Additionally, these dynamics are embedded in and are strongly influenced
  by the socio-­ historical context and concurrent events, such as COVID-­19. This
  study examines how different groups of emerging adults (university students and
  workers) engage in identity processes in educational/vocational and interpersonal
  domains and frame their perspective of time before (N = 299, Mage = 21.90; 51.4%
  females) and during the pandemic (N = 497; Mage = 23.11; 68.2% females). Significant
  differences in identity processes and time perspective emerged between the two cohorts.
  Moreover, significant associations between identity and time perspective were found
  to be similar across different identity domains and cohorts.
