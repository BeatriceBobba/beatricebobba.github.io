abstract: Sense of academic futility entails feelings of having no control over ones'
  educational success. Although mounting evidence points to its negative consequences
  for students' educational outcomes, less is known about its socio-­contextual antecedents.
  Relatedly, the current study explored how fair and supportive relationships with
  teachers are related to the sense of academic futility and if class belonging mediates
  this link in a sample of adolescents with immigrant and non-­immigrant backgrounds.
  A total of 1065 seventh-­grade students (Mage = 13.12; SD = 0.42; 45% girls) from
  55 classrooms completed questionnaires at two time points 1 year apart. Results
  of multilevel analyses indicated that fair and supportive relationships with teachers
  contributed to decreases in sense of academic futility at the individual but not
  at the classroom level. No mediation or moderation effects emerged. These findings
  highlight the crucial role of democratic student–teacher relationships in supporting
  the positive school adjustment of all students in increasingly multicultural societies.
