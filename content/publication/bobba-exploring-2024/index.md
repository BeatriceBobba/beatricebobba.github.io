abstract: Study abroad experiences can be an important asset for individuals’ personal
  development and well-being. However, their impact on social identity domains and
  prejudice is still unex­ plored. The current research examined whether the ways
  in which youth retrospectively nar­ rate their abroad experiences in adolescence
  were intertwined with their national and European identity processes and ethnic
  prejudice. A total of 117 Italian youth (Mage ¼ 22.71, SD ¼ 2.50; 53.8% females)
  who participated in a mobility program in adolescence completed an online questionnaire
  and a retrospective narrative interview. Agency and self-event con­ nections in
  the narratives were directly linked to identity processes in national and European
  domains. European identity processes were associated with different levels of affective
  and cognitive prejudice. Across both identity domains, the number of self-event
  connections in the narratives was indirectly linked to lower affective prejudice
  via increased in-depth exploration. These findings highlight the importance of abroad
  experiences for consolidating self- and other-oriented views.
