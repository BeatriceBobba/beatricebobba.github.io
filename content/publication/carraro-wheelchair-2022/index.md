abstract: Background Participation in sports is known to have positive effects on
  people's health and psychosocial well-being. Recently, physical activity implications
  for people with disabilities have been explored, showing promising results on quality
  of life and self-concept. However, few studies have specifically investigated the
  effects of participation in adaptive sports on quality of life in patients with
  neuromuscular disease. Objective To evaluate differences in psychosocial well-being
  between people affected by a neuromuscular disease who play wheelchair hockey and
  those who do not. Individuals playing an adaptive sport would report better quality
  of life, higher physical self-efficacy scores, and more effective coping strategies,
  as assessed by self-reported measures. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Data
  were collected during clinical follow-ups at the NEMO Clinical Center in Milan (Italy).
  Participants A total of 25 patients affected by neuromuscular diseases, ages 18
  to 40 years, participated in the study. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome
  measures The primary outcome was to compare quality of life between groups. Secondary
  outcomes were the comparisons of physical self-efficacy and coping strategies through
  self-reported measures. Results Wheelchair hockey players scored significantly higher
  on the Quality of Life Index (specifically on the health/functioning and psychological/spiritual
  sub-scales) and reported better physical self-efficacy and perceived physical ability
  compared to the control group (i.e., patients who do not participate in any adaptive
  sport), controlling for age and pathology. On the contrary, no difference was found
  in coping strategies between the two groups. Conclusions This study identified a
  significant association between participation in wheelchair hockey and improved
  physical and psychological well-being of people affected by neuromuscular diseases
  compared to those who are not involved in adaptive sports.
