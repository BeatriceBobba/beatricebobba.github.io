abstract: Dramatic changes in sleep duration, schedules, and quality put adolescents
  at higher risk of negative outcomes, such as poorer physical and psychosocial adjustment.
  While significant attention has been paid to the role of proximal contexts (e.g.,
  family), less is known about the longitudinal interplay between exo- (e.g., neighborhood
  characteristics) and macrocontextual (e.g., ethnic/racial discrimination) influences
  and adolescents’ sleep quality. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize findings
  from available longitudinal research to understand the role of structural factors
  and experiences in the distal contexts of development in influencing sleep quality
  in adolescence. A total of 10 studies were included in this systematic review. The
  results highlighted the detrimental consequences of structural factors and experiences
  at the exo- and macro-systems for adolescents’ sleep duration, quality, and disturbances.
  Specifically, neighborhood economic deprivation, ethnic/racial minority status,
  community violence and victimization, and ethnic/racial discrimination were all
  linked to significantly lower sleep quality. Overall, this review highlighted the
  need for more longitudinal and multimethod studies addressing sleep quality as embedded
  in contexts and the reciprocal influences among the multiple layers of adolescents’
  development.
