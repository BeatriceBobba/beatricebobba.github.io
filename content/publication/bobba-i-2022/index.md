abstract: Empathic competences might help adolescents navigate current multicultural
  societies by supporting harmonious intergroup relations. Yet it is unclear how each
  component of empathy (empathic concern and perspective-taking) is associated with
  different dimensions (affective, cognitive, behavioral) of ethnic prejudice. The
  current study aims to ﬁll this gap. A total of 259 Italian adolescents (Mage = 15.60,
  87.6% female) completed online questionnaires at three time points (i.e., April,
  May, and October 2021). The results of cross-lagged models indicated that empathic
  concern was directly and indirectly associated with reduced affective, cognitive,
  and behavioral ethnic prejudice, while perspective-taking was linked to increases
  in cognitive and one facet of behavioral (i.e., lower contact willingness) prejudice.
  Furthermore, the prevalence of affect over cognition was found, with the affective
  component of both empathic competences (i.e., empathic concern) and ethnic prejudice
  exerting the strongest inﬂuence on the cognitive ones.
