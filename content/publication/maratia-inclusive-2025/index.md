abstract: Schools are increasingly culturally diverse. Yet, it is unclear whether
  a positive school diversity climate influences students' academic achievement and
  social well-being, and the role of school belonging in explaining this effect. A
  total of 1156 adolescents (Mage = 15.69, 51.65 % females and 48.35 % males) residents
  in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy, participated in a longitudinal study with four
  assessments across one year. Most participants (78.96 %) belonged to the majority
  group (i.e., both they and their parents were born in Italy), while 21.04 % had
  a migrant background (i.e., themselves or at least one of their parents was born
  outside Italy). Results highlighted meaningful associations between school diversity
  climate and adolescents' academic achievement and social well-being. Concurrently,
  both perceived equal treatment and support for contact and cooperation were associated
  with adolescents' higher academic achievement and social well-being. Longitudinally,
  perceived equal treatment by teachers led to a higher sense of school belonging,
  contributing to increased social well-being. Students' migrant background moderated
  the impact of school diversity climate on youth's social well-being. Overall, findings
  highlight how inclusive schools can generate more inclusive societies.
